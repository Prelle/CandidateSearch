## Installation

To install, you will need a GitHub API key which needs to be added to a .env file in the root folder. You will then need to run `npm ci` to install dependencies.

## Usage

After installation, start the project locally with `npm run dev`. This will run a Vite instance hosting the application. Once running, you can open a browser window pointed at the Vite path to use the application.

## Testing

You can run the application using test data (as shown above) by setting the value of `VITE_TEST_DATA` to `true` in your `.env` file.
